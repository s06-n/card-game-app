# Part 2


## Submit quick summary justification for your design choices

The way we have designed our game site follows the theme a lot of games websites use to make it easy for new users to follow the interface.

We have kept all of the pages simple and only have the necessary elements required for that part of the site. We have positioned them as presented so that it is clear and not too busy for the interface. This will be amended as and when it is all being put together depending on size of the features.

### Landing Page:
Easy to follow
Image to make it clear what the theme of the website is (card game style)
Clear buttons/links to other areas of the site

### Meet the Team:
Clear sections for each member of the team
thinking about adding profile photo for each member

### Games Rules:
Easy to follow
clear and concise
again follows the card game theme that we have seen online

### Play the Game Page:
There will be an animation that makes it more interactive for the user
it will show a deck of cards shuffling and then they will "deal" out for the user to see

### Leaderboard:
Easy to follow
Table clearly laid out
will look to put Bronze, Silver and Gold trophies beside 1st, 2nd and 3rd
If score is the same players will be ranked by time it took for them to complete the game

### Player Profile:
Easy to follow
Not too much detail but looking at other games sites it gives a lot of what users will look for

### Login Page
follows a generic login page that users will recognise and be able to easily use
able to log in with multiple methods

## Make sure that there are some colours - add justification for the colours used
All of the pages will have a green background and use the colours from a deck of cards as text colour and other backgrounds (for example Red, black and yellow as the face cards being used).

## Good/bad design choices
One thing we think is currently "bad" is the colour scheme. At the moment we have done everything as a Green theme, but will look to improve this and change the colour palette so things stand out in the right way.
We are also thinking of maybe an orange/red background that suggests the seriousness of the leadership page.
